# Portfolio Project Monorepo

This repository contains the complete source code for my personal portfolio ecosystem, comprising a public-facing frontend, a private back-office dashboard, and a unified backend API.

## Project Structure

- **`frontend/`**:  
  The public portfolio website built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. It showcases my projects, experience, and skills to the world.

- **`back-office/`**:  
  A secured administrative dashboard built with **Next.js** and **Radix UI**. It allows management of all portfolio content, including profile details, projects, inbox messages, blog posts, and content creation.

- **`backend/`**:  
  The core API built with **FastAPI**, **SQLModel**, and **PostgreSQL**. It serves data to both the frontend and back-office, handling database interactions, file uploads, and business logic.
